# Change Log

## PicoVerse 2040 Multirom v2.60

- Moved the shared MultiROM version declaration into the aggregate and tool Makefiles, removing the separate `version.mk` include.
- Refreshed the generated ROM mapper SHA1 database from the current openMSX `softwaredb.xml` and updated the generator to parse the new attribute-based XML format.
  
## PicoVerse 2040 Multirom v2.59

- Bumped the multirom.pio version to v2.59.
- Changed the memory-read `/WAIT` driver to open-drain behaviour: the firmware now asserts `/WAIT` by pulling it low and releases the shared line as hi-Z after stretched read cycles and ROM-cache setup.

## PicoVerse 2040 Multirom v2.58

- Bumped the multirom.pio version to v2.58.
- Set all multirom.pio firmware target system clocks to 230 MHz to improve stability with pico boards with bad quality flash memory.

## PicoVerse 2040 Multirom v2.57

- Updated the MSX MultiROM menu separator lines to use the same custom MSX glyph used by Explorer, copying character pattern `0x17` into printable slot `0x7E` and rendering that glyph instead of ASCII hyphens.
- Removed the unused MSX menu configuration screen and disabled the `C`/`c` key shortcut that opened it.
