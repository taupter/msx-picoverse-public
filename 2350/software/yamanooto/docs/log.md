# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.13

- Removed the software PSG DC blocker to fix PSG noise under SCC (matches Explorer's clean SCC + PSG).
- Version bumped to v1.13 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.12

- Applied the FM path's audible-gated PSG handling to the SCC path too, removing PSG noise under SCC.
- Version bumped to v1.12 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.11

- Fixed FM noise reintroduced by v1.10's always-render PSG, using context-aware PSG mixing.
- PSG mixing is now context-aware, matching the two Explorer paths:
  * FM primary  -> audible-gated PSG (`psg_mix_gated`): idle PSGs skip `PSG_calc`, keeping core 1
    within budget; the gate transitions are masked by the FM and the DC blocker.
  * PSG / SCC primary -> full PSG (`psg_mix_sample`): both PSGs clocked and mixed every sample so
    there are no mute/unmute clicks (the pure-PSG behaviour fixed in v1.10 is preserved).
- Version bumped to v1.11 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.
- Added `docs/msx-picoverse-2350-yamanooto.md` (implementation guide) and
  `docs/msx-picoverse-2350-yamanooto-tool-manual.en-us.md` (PC tool manual).
- Updated `docs/msx-picoverse-public-readme.md` (highlights, 2350 section, documentation links,
  Yamanooto tool manual link, and credits for the Genami Yamanooto / openMSX Yamanooto.cc references)
  and `docs/presentation/msx-cartridge-comparison.md` (Yamanooto listed as a PicoVerse 2350 exclusive).

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.10

- Removed the remaining mute/unmute clicking on PSG by always rendering the PSG (like Explorer).
- Version bumped to v1.10 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.09

- Fixed the constant beep on pure-PSG games (was the idle OPLL being rendered).
- Version bumped to v1.09 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.08

- Fixed the constant mute/unmute artifact on PSG-only games.
- The PSG is now clocked AND mixed every sample while in use, exactly like the Explorer standalone
  PSG path: its output falls to the idle level naturally during a rest, so there is no on/off step.
  A PSG is only dropped from the mix once it has been silent for the whole ~200 ms keep-alive
  window, so idle PSGs still add no buzz under FM/SCC.
- Version bumped to v1.08 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.07

- Fixed PSG-mirror noise (crackle) while keeping FM and SCC clean.
- Version bumped to v1.07 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.06

- Dual PSG is now only rendered when audible, added a main-PSG mirror, and reduced the residual
noise heard under FM music.
- PSG audible gating: a PSG channel is only mixed when it has a non-zero fixed volume (or a
  running envelope) AND its tone or noise is enabled in the mixer. Idle PSGs (all volumes 0 with
  every channel enabled after reset) previously added a low-level buzz that was audible under the
  quieter FM music; they now contribute nothing. This applies to both PSGs and also skips the
  `PSG_calc` work when silent. Mirrors the Explorer PSG behaviour.
- Added a PSG mirror: writes to the main MSX PSG ports (`0xA0`/`0xA1`) now drive a second PSG
  instance that is mixed (audible-gated) into the cartridge DAC, so the system PSG is heard
  through the same output as SCC/FM. Echo mode still additionally drives the secondary PSG.
- The FM + PSG mix is soft-limited (compressed) instead of hard-clipped; the SCC + PSG path keeps
  its original hard clamp.
- Version bumped to v1.06 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.05

- MSX-MUSIC is now always enabled, and the SCC-vs-FM audio engine is chosen at runtime so a
single flash image can hold a mix of SCC games and FM games.
- The cartridge is always presented as the expanded slot with the FM-PAC BIOS in sub-slot 3;
  the OPLL is always created. The plain (non-expanded) run path was removed and `main()` always
  runs the FM-PAC loop.
- On-the-fly engine selection: the SCC and FM engines are never used together by one game but a
  multi-ROM image can contain both, so the audio core now picks the engine per buffer from recent
  sound-register write activity (`scc_activity` bumped on SCC register-window writes while the SCC
  is enabled; `fm_activity` bumped on OPLL writes) and renders only that engine (+ the secondary
  PSG). This keeps the core-1 per-sample budget within range while supporting both game types.
- Removed the `-f` / `--fmpac` / `--msx-music` option: the FM-PAC BIOS is always embedded and
  appended after the ROM image.
- Version bumped to v1.05 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.04

- Further fix for robotic MSX-MUSIC audio: reduced the core-1 per-sample workload.
- Version bumped to v1.04 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.03

- Fixed the "robotic" MSX-MUSIC audio, following the Explorer FM path.
- Version bumped to v1.03 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.02

- Fixed MSX-MUSIC games not playing music: the OPLL is now presented with the **FM-PAC BIOS**
so games can detect the FM chip (previously only the raw I/O ports were emulated, which is
insufficient for BIOS-detecting games).
- Version bumped to v1.02 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building;
  the tool packages a UF2 with the FM-PAC BIOS appended when `-f` is selected.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.01

- Added optional **MSX-MUSIC** (YM2413 / OPLL) emulation, modelled on the MSX-MUSIC work in
`2350/software/explorer.pio` / `loadrom.pio`.
- Added the `emu2413` (YM2413/OPLL) engine to the build.
- When enabled, an OPLL instance is created (`OPLL_2413_TONE`, 3.579545 MHz, 44.1 kHz) and
  MSX-MUSIC I/O writes on ports `0x7C`/`0x7D` (captured on the PIO1 I/O bus) are dispatched to
  it; the FM output is mixed into the core-1 audio stream alongside the SCC and secondary PSG.
- MSX-MUSIC is off by default and activated by the `0x20` flag in the config-record `type`
  byte; the OPLL is serviced/rendered on core 1 only, so no cross-core locking is required.
- Added the `-f` / `--fmpac` / `--msx-music` flag which sets the `0x20` MSX-MUSIC bit in the
  config-record `type` byte, and reports the selection.
- Version bumped to v1.01 (top-level and tool Makefiles). Firmware and tool verified building;
  the tool packages a UF2 with and without `-f`.

# PicoVerse 2350 Yamanooto v1.0

- Initial implementation of the **Yamanooto** flash cartridge emulation for the
PicoVerse 2350, modelled on the openMSX `Yamanooto` device and reusing the SCC/SCC+ and
dual-PSG work from `2350/software/explorer.pio` / `loadrom.pio`.
- Added `yamanooto.c` / `yamanooto.h`: PIO-based emulation of the Yamanooto Konami-SCC
  compatible flash cartridge.
- Konami-SCC mapper (default) and Konami-4 mapper (CFGR `K4` bit): 10-bit bank registers
  with the global bank offset `(OFFR << 2) | (CFGR SUBOFF >> 4)`; `MDIS` disables banking.
- Memory-mapped register window at `0x7FFC-0x7FFF` (not mirrored), gated by `ENAR` `REGEN`:
  `ENAR` (`REGEN`/`WREN`), `OFFR`, `CFGR` (`MDIS`/`ECHO`/`ROMDIS`/`K4`/`SUBOFF`/`FPGA_EN`),
  and the FPGA channel (`FPGA_REG`) with the minimal read-ID handshake returning
  `{0xFF,0x1F,0x23,0x00,0x00}` and `FPGA_WAIT` always ready.
- SCC / SCC+ audio via `emu2212` (type `SCC_ENHANCED`): every mapper-region write is fed to
  the SCC engine, which auto-detects SCC (bank2 == `0x3F`), SCC+ (bank3 bit7) and the mode
  register at `0xBFFE`; SCC register reads decode `base_adr + 0x800`. Disabled in K4 mode.
- Secondary (dual) PSG via `emu2149` on I/O ports `0x10`/`0x11`, echoed to `0xA0`/`0xA1` when
  `CFGR ECHO` is set (captured on PIO1); SCC and PSG are mixed into the I2S DAC on core 1.
- ROM image served directly from flash XIP through `getFlashAddr`, guarded by the image size
  (unprogrammed reads return `0xFF`); `ROMDIS` returns `0xFF`. Address mirroring 0x4000<->0xC000
  and 0x8000<->0x0000 reproduced.
- Flash programming (`WREN` + AmdFlash command sequences) is intentionally not emulated;
  write cycles with `WREN` set are ignored so the emulated banks are never corrupted. The
  firmware runs pre-flashed images.
- Reused `emu2212`, `emu2149`, `msx_bus.pio`, and the CMake import scripts from `loadrom.pio`.
- `CMakeLists.txt` targets `pimoroni_pga2350` (RP2350B), 210 MHz, I2S on PIO0 SM2, MSX memory
  bus on PIO0 SM0/SM1 and the PSG I/O bus on PIO1 SM0/SM1.
- Added `src/yamanooto.c`: Windows console UF2 creator. Packs the embedded firmware, a 59-byte
  config record (name + type + size + offset) and the user ROM image (up to 8 MB) into a
  UF2 (RP2350 family, 256-byte payloads).
- `Makefile` regenerates the embedded firmware header (`src/yamanooto.h`) with `xxd` and builds
  `dist/yamanooto.exe`.
- Top-level `Makefile` builds the firmware (CMake/Ninja) and the tool.
- Verified: firmware links (`yamanooto.uf2`/`.bin` produced) and the tool packages a UF2 from a
  128 KB test image.
