# Change Log

## PicoVerse 2350 Multirom v2.61
- Bumped the multirom.pio version to v2.61.
- Improved MSX MultiROM menu drawing by rendering ROM rows with a single VRAM block write, preserving long-name scrolling from the first visible character.
- Fixed short mapper labels in the optimized row renderer so they pad with spaces instead of leaking stray characters at the end of the line.
- Reduced page-navigation redraws so page changes update only the ROM rows and footer instead of repainting the static title and separator lines.
- Fixed the MultiROM tool mapper detector so 8KB ROMs do not read past the ROM buffer when building images with embedded Sunrise/mapper options.
- Frogger - Konami (1983) [RC-704] rom on the MSX1 Konami compilation had a bug and was replaced by a working dump from File Hunter.

## PicoVerse 2350 Multirom v2.59
- Refreshed the generated ROM mapper SHA1 database from the current openMSX `softwaredb.xml` and updated the shared generator to parse the new attribute-based XML format.

## PicoVerse 2350 Multirom v2.58

- Bumped the multirom.pio version to v2.58.
- Changed the memory-read `/WAIT` driver to open-drain behaviour: the firmware now asserts `/WAIT` by pulling it low and releases the shared line as hi-Z after stretched read cycles and ROM-cache setup.

## PicoVerse 2350 Multirom v2.57

- Updated the MSX MultiROM menu separator lines to use the same custom MSX glyph used by Explorer, copying character pattern `0x17` into printable slot `0x7E` and rendering that glyph instead of ASCII hyphens.
- Removed the unused MSX menu configuration screen and disabled the `C`/`c` key shortcut that opened it.
