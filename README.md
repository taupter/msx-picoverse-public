# PicoVerse for MSX

**The MSX experience driven by the Raspberry Pi Pico family of microcontrollers.**

PicoVerse is a community-driven effort to build versatile MSX cartridges powered by Raspberry Pi Pico development boards. The project pairs accessible hardware designs with ready-to-flash firmware so MSX users can jump straight into loading games, tools, and Nextor without having to compile sources.

| Cartridge Label - 2040 Variant | Cartridge Label - 2350 Variant |

PicoVerse is designed as an open-source, independent, and documented MSX cartridge platform. Compatibility with other projects is neither a goal nor guaranteed (I tested some without much success); running third‑party software on PicoVerse hardware, or PicoVerse firmware on other boards, is at your own risk. The source and manufacturing files are openly available so you can learn, experiment, and build on them for the MSX community, subject to the project license.

## Whats New in PicoVerse?

- New Sunrise IDE emulation feature and Nextor support on the PicoVerse 2040 cartridge, allowing the USB-C port to function as a Sunrise IDE-compatible hard disk. Full documentation available [here](/docs/msx-picoverse-2040-sunrise-nextor.md) ***(NEW!)***
- Both PicoVerse 2040 PIO based LoadROM and MultiROM tools now support Sunrise IDE emulation with Nextor ***(NEW!)***
- Updated PicoVerse 2040 LoadROM and MultiROM with improved mapper RAM capacity (192KB) and better Nextor compatibility, including stable boot and runtime behavior in MSX1 and MSX2 environments. ***(NEW!)***
- Added ASCII16-X mapper support to all PicoVerse 2040 firmware variants, with auto-detection heuristics and filename tag overrides in the LoadROM and MultiROM tools. ***(NEW!)*** 
- New PIO based **MultiROM** firmware and tool for PicoVerse 2350 (`2350/software/multirom.pio`) with automatic SCC emulation for Konami SCC ROMs. ***(NEW!)***

## Repository Contents
- `hardware/` – Production-ready Gerbers, fabrication notes, and BOMs for each supported dev board.
- `software/` – MultiROM PC utilities (`multirom.exe`) and menu ROM assets for both cartridge families.
- `docs/` – Feature lists, usage walkthroughs, and revision history for each cartridge family.
- `images/` – Board renders and build photos for quick identification.
- `labels/` – Printable Patola style cartridge label designs for both hardware variants.

## Quick Start
1. **Pick your target board**: Select the hardware revision that matches the RP2040 or RP2350 carrier you own, then grab the corresponding Gerber/BOM pack.
2. **Manufacture or assemble**: Send the Gerbers to your PCB house or build from an ordered kit. Follow the assembly notes included in each hardware bundle.
3. **Generate the UF2 image**:
   - For multiple titles, place your `.rom` files beside the MultiROM tool for your cartridge family (`2040/software/multirom/multirom.exe` or `2350/software/multirom/multirom.exe`) and run `multirom.exe` to create `multirom.uf2`.
   - For an instant boot into a single game, place the desired `.rom` next to the LoadROM tool for your cartridge family and run `loadrom.exe <file> [-o custom.uf2]` to create a dedicated UF2 that skips the menu.
   - For a combined flash + microSD menu on RP2350, use the Explorer tool (`2350/software/explorer/tool/explorer.exe`) to create `explorer.uf2`, then copy extra `.rom` and `.mp3` files to the microSD card.
4. **Flash the firmware**:
   - Hold BOOTSEL while connecting the cartridge to your PC via USB-C.
   - Copy the freshly generated UF2 (`multirom.uf2`, `loadrom.uf2`, or `explorer.uf2`) to the RPI-RP2 drive that appears.
   - Eject the drive; the board reboots and stores the image in flash.
5. **Enjoy on MSX**: Insert the cartridge, power on the computer, pick a ROM from the menu, or launch Nextor to access USB or microSD storage.

## MultiROM Menu

| PicoVerse 2040 MultiRom | PicoVerse 2350 MultiRom |
|---------|---------|
|![alt text](/images/multirom_2040_menu.png)|![alt text](/images/multirom_2350_menu.png)|

To use the MultiROM menu, insert the PicoVerse cartridge into your MSX and power it on. The system will boot directly into the MultiROM menu, which displays a list of all ROMs embedded in the cartridge. Each entry is named after the ROM filename (up to 50 characters), and longer names are shown using a scrolling effect.

Navigate the menu using the keyboard arrow keys. Use the Up and Down keys to move through the list of ROMs, and if more than 19 ROMs are present, use the Left and Right keys to switch between pages. To start a game or application, select it and press Enter or Space; the MSX will boot the ROM using the appropriate mapper configuration automatically.

While in the menu, pressing the H key opens a help screen with basic instructions; press any key to return to the main menu. Once a ROM is launched, control is handed over entirely to the selected software, just as if it were a physical cartridge inserted into the MSX.

Check the detailed MultiROM guide in the documentation folder for advanced features, troubleshooting tips, and mapper support details.

## LoadROM Tool

The LoadROM tool targets situations where you want the PicoVerse to behave like a traditional single-game cartridge. Instead of showing the MultiROM menu, the Pico boots straight into one ROM embedded in the UF2 image.

- **Input**: exactly one `.ROM` file. Mapper type is auto-detected with the same heuristics as MultiROM, and you can still force a mapper via filename tags such as `.KonSCC.ROM` or `.PL-32.ROM`.
- **Output**: `loadrom.uf2` by default, or any filename you pass via `-o`. The UF2 contains the firmware, a 59-byte configuration record (title, mapper, size, flash offset), and the ROM payload.
- **Workflow**:
   1. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window in your target package folder:
      - `2350/software/loadrom/tool` (legacy bit-banged firmware), or
      - `2350/software/loadrom.pio/tool` (PIO-based firmware, recommended).
   2. Run `loadrom.exe -o mygame.uf2 \\path\\to\\Game.ROM` (the tool also accepts drag-and-drop onto the EXE).
      - SCC standard emulation: `loadrom.exe -scc \\path\\to\\Game.ROM`
      - SCC+ enhanced emulation: `loadrom.exe -sccplus \\path\\to\\Game.ROM`
      - `-scc` and `-sccplus` are mutually exclusive.
      - SCC/SCC+ options are supported only in `2350/software/loadrom.pio/tool` (PIO firmware path), not in legacy `2350/software/loadrom/tool`.
   3. Observe the reported ROM name, size, mapper status (auto vs forced), and Pico offset before the UF2 is written.
   4. Put the Pico into BOOTSEL mode and copy the generated UF2 to the `RPI-RP2` drive.
   5. Insert the cartridge into your MSX—on power-up the embedded game launches immediately.

Consult the LoadROM manuals linked above for screenshots, troubleshooting, and in-depth explanations of mapper forcing, UF2 structure, and limitations.

Explorer is a 2350-only firmware that merges ROMs stored in flash with additional ROMs and MP3 files on the microSD card. ROMs are labeled with source tags (FL/SD), MP3 entries open a player screen, the list supports paging, and you can search by name directly in the menu. Use the Explorer tool to build the UF2 and copy extra ROMs and MP3 files to the microSD card. See the Explorer manual for limits (flash vs SD capacity, 256 KB SD ROM limit, and supported formats).

You can have up to 1024 entries per folder view (folders + ROMs + MP3s; the root view can also include flash entries). The menu auto-detects whether the MSX supports 80-column text mode and boots accordingly; you can also press `C` at any time to toggle between 40- and 80-column layouts.

A search function is available by pressing `/` in the menu. Type part of a ROM name and press Enter to jump to the first matching entry. Press `H` to view the help screen.

## Compatibility & Requirements

- Works with MSX, MSX2, MSX2+, and MSX TurboR systems. Mapper support covers the most common game and utility formats.
- Requires Windows OS to run the PC-side UF2 builder utilities.
- Ensure your development board matches the pinout documented for each hardware revision before soldering.
