# MSX PicoVerse 2350 Explorer Tool Manual (EN-US)

The Explorer tool creates a UF2 image that flashes the PicoVerse 2350 cartridge with the Explorer firmware. The UF2 bundles:
- PicoVerse 2350 Explorer firmware.
- The full 32KB MSX Explorer menu ROM.
- A configuration table describing each ROM stored in flash (stored in flash immediately after the menu ROM).
- The ROM payloads that will live in Pico flash.
- The integrated File Hunter browser and WiFi configuration support used by the Explorer menu.

Use the Explorer tool when you want a menu that loads ROMs from flash, microSD, and the online File Hunter catalog on the PicoVerse 2350, or if you want to explore advanced features like microSD MP3 playback, SCC/SCC+ audio, Dual PSG audio, MSX-MUSIC, and optional primary PSG mirroring through the cartridge DAC on your MSX computer.

## Requirements

- Windows PC (the distributed binary is a Windows console app).
- A folder containing the `.ROM` files you want stored in flash.
- A PicoVerse 2350 cartridge and USB-C cable.
- Optional: a microSD card (for additional ROMs, MP3/WAV files, and Sunrise Nextor SD storage).
- Optional but required for File Hunter: an ESP-01 / ESP8266 module with compatible firmware, installed on the PicoVerse 2350 WiFi header and configured for your wireless network.

## Limits

- Flash ROM entries created by the tool: up to 128 files.
- Combined Explorer menu limit: 1024 entries per folder view (folders + ROMs + MP3s; the root view also includes ROM files stored directly on the flash memory).
- Total flash ROM payload size: ~14 MB combined.
- Supported ROM size range on the flash: 8 KB to ~14 MB.
- ROM names in the menu are limited to 60 characters (longer names are truncated).
- File Hunter search text is limited to 24 characters.
- File Hunter downloads are saved as `.ROM` files directly in the root of the microSD card.

## Basic workflow

1. Put all `.ROM` files you want in the Pico flash into a single folder (no subfolders).
2. Run the tool in that folder to create `explorer.uf2`.
3. Put the PicoVerse 2350 into BOOTSEL mode and copy the UF2 to the `RPI-RP2` drive.
4. (Optional) Copy more `.ROM` and `.MP3` files to a microSD card for SD loading.
5. (Optional) Insert an ESP-01 module and configure WiFi from the Explorer menu if you want to browse File Hunter.
6. Insert the cartridge into your MSX and power on.

### Explorer menu capabilities

- **Folder navigation**: Organize your ROMs into folders on the microSD card. Enter folders by pressing Enter or Space on a folder name, and navigate back to parent folders using the ".." entry or by pressing Esc.
- **Search** by ROM name directly on the MSX by pressing `/`, typing part of the name, and pressing Enter to jump to the first match. Note that this feature only searches ROMs inside the current folder. When in the root, it searches all flash and SD ROMs located in the root.
- **File Hunter browser**: Press `F3` to browse online ROM results from File Hunter through the ESP-01 WiFi module. Results show the ROM name, size, and source, and selected ROMs can be downloaded and saved to the microSD root.
- **WiFi configuration**: Press `F4` to enter the WiFi setup flow used by the ESP8266P-compatible WiFi firmware.
- **Automatic detection** of MSX models that support 80-column text mode. Compatible machines boot the menu in 80 columns; others fall back to 40 columns, and you can press `C` at any time to toggle between layouts.
- MP3 entries from the microSD card are listed in the menu with a "MP3" type label and open an **MP3 player** screen when selected.
- ROM entries open a ROM screen that lets you inspect mapper detection, choose **audio profiles** including SCC/SCC+, Dual PSG, or MSX-MUSIC where supported, enable optional primary **PSG** mirroring to the DAC, and enable optional WiFi support for Sunrise Nextor entries before running.

## Command-line usage

```
explorer.exe [options]
```

### Options

- `-h`, `--help` : Show usage help and exit.
- `-o <filename>`, `--output <filename>` : Set UF2 output filename (default is `explorer.uf2`).
- `-n`, `--nextor` : Include embedded Nextor ROM (experimental; MSX2-only). In the 2350 build, this is labeled “Nextor SD (IO)”.

### Example

```
explorer.exe
```

This scans the current directory and generates `explorer.uf2`.

## ROM mapper detection and tags

For the flash entries, the PC tool analyzes each ROM to determine the mapper. If you need to override it, add a mapper tag to the filename before `.ROM`. Tags are case-insensitive.

Supported tags:
`PL-16`, `PL-32`, `KonSCC`, `Linear`, `PL-64`, `ASC-08`, `ASC-16`, `Konami`, `NEO-8`, `NEO-16`, `ASC-16X`, `MANBW2`.

Mapper detection on the Pico (for unknown SD ROMs) and on the PC tool both use a shared SHA-1 ROM database derived from openMSX's `softwaredb.xml`, falling back to heuristic scanning when the SHA-1 is not in the database.

Example:

```
Knight Mare.PL-32.ROM
```

Notes:
- The `SYSTEM` tag is ignored and cannot be forced.
- Unsupported ROMs are skipped.

## Using microSD with Explorer

Explorer can load ROMs from a microSD card in addition to flash. ROMs on SD are merged into the menu list and marked with the "SD" source tag. You can organize your ROM collection into folders for easier navigation.

- Format Explorer browsing partitions as FAT16, FAT32, or exFAT.
- Explorer can enumerate supported primary and logical partitions. Press `P` while in the `F2` microSD screen to cycle between supported partitions.
- The selected Explorer browsing partition is saved in `/PICOVERSE.PVC` on the first supported partition and restored on later boots.
- The lower status area shows the selected partition label and free MB. In 40-column mode, the label and free-space amount alternate so both remain readable.
- Copy `.ROM` and `.MP3` files to the root of the card or organize them in subfolders for better organization.
- SD ROMs appear in the menu with the source label "SD".
- MP3 files appear in the menu with the "MP3" type label and open the MP3 player screen.
- Flash ROMs appear with the source label "FL".
- File Hunter downloads are saved directly to the root of the microSD card and then appear as normal SD ROM files in the Explorer root list.
- Folders are displayed in the menu and can be entered to browse their contents.
- The special ".." entry appears when inside a folder, allowing you to navigate back to the parent directory.

### Sunrise Nextor SD partitions in Explorer

Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM entries use stricter partition rules than the normal `F2` microSD browser. Nextor SD storage is offered only for FAT16 microSD partitions up to 4 GB. FAT32 and exFAT partitions remain usable for Explorer file browsing, ROM loading, MP3/WAV playback, and File Hunter downloads, but they are not offered to Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM ROMs.

When a Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM entry is opened in the ROM screen, Explorer shows the compatible FAT16 partition label in the `SD Part` option. If more than one compatible FAT16 partition exists, use Left/Right on `SD Part` to choose the partition before running. The selected partition is saved in that ROM's `.PVC` options file, so each Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM entry can remember its own storage partition.

### microSD limitations

- The combined list is capped at 1024 entries per folder view (folders + ROMs + MP3s; the root view can also include flash entries).
- microSD ROM files are limited to 4 MB each. ROMs are streamed into the cartridge's 8 MB external PSRAM (QMI CS1, 52.5 MHz QPI) and executed from there; the first 256 KB are mirrored into the PSRAM ROM cache for mapper access. ROMs larger than 4 MB are skipped during enumeration.
- Unsupported or invalid ROMs are skipped (same mapper and size rules as flash).

### Performance note: MSX Response Time

MSX computers have slower processors compared to modern hardware. When navigating to a folder with a large number of ROMs (100+), the Pico will scan the directory contents and you will see a blinking "Loading..." message. This is normal behavior:

- **Small folders (< 50 ROMs)**: Directory listing typically completes in 1-2 seconds.
- **Large folders (100-900 ROMs)**: Directory listing may take over 5 seconds depending on the microSD card speed and the number of files.

For the best experience with very large ROM collections, consider organizing ROMs into subfolders by category (e.g., ACTION, PUZZLE, RPG) rather than storing all ROMs in a single folder.

## Menu usage (on MSX)

- **Up/Down**: Move selection up or down in the list.
- **Left/Right**: Change pages (when the list spans multiple pages).
- **Enter**: Open the selected entry. Folders enter the directory, MP3 entries open the MP3 player screen, and ROM entries open the ROM screen.
- **Space**: Enter folders and open MP3 entries like Enter. On ROM entries, quick-run the ROM using saved `.PVC` options when present or default settings when no `.PVC` file exists. Unknown SD ROM mappers are detected before launch.
- **Esc**: Navigate back to the parent folder (when inside a folder). Same as pressing Enter/Space on the ".." entry.
- **F1**: Switch the Explorer list to flash ROMs.
- **F2**: Switch the Explorer list to microSD files and folders.
- **F3**: Open the integrated File Hunter browser.
- **F4**: Open WiFi configuration.
- **H**: Show help screen.
- **P**: In the `F2` microSD screen, cycle through supported FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT partitions. The selected browsing partition is saved in `/PICOVERSE.PVC`.
- **D**: In the `F2` microSD screen, delete the selected file after a `Y/N` confirmation. This command is valid for files only; folders are protected.
- **/**: Search ROM names. Type a partial name and press Enter to jump to the first matching ROM.
- **C**: Toggle between 40-column and 80-column layouts when your MSX supports it (auto-detects 80-column capable machines and defaults to 80 columns unless forced otherwise).

### Folder navigation workflow

1. The root menu lists all flash ROMs and files/folders from the microSD card root.
2. Folders appear in the list with a \<DIR\> indicator.
3. Press Enter or Space on a folder name to enter it and view its contents.
4. While loading a folder (especially large folders with many ROMs), you will see a blinking "Loading..." message on the bottom left corner. This is normal and indicates the Pico is scanning the directory.
5. Once loaded, navigate using Up/Down arrows as usual.
6. Press Esc or select the ".." entry to return to the parent folder or root.
7. Repeat to drill down through nested folders as needed.

## File Hunter browser

Explorer includes an integrated File Hunter browser for PicoVerse 2350 cartridges fitted with an ESP-01 / ESP8266 module. The browser talks directly from the Pico firmware to the ESP module, queries the public File Hunter service, downloads the selected ROM into PSRAM, and then saves it as a `.ROM` file in the root of the microSD card.

The File Hunter integration is inspired by NataliaPC's MSX File Hunter Browser project and uses the public File Hunter catalog endpoint. See the external reference section near the end of this document for the upstream project link.

### Before using File Hunter

- Install an ESP-01 / ESP8266 module on the PicoVerse 2350 WiFi header.
- Use ESP firmware compatible with the ESP8266P / memio command protocol used by PicoVerse.
- Insert a FAT16, FAT32, or exFAT microSD browsing partition. File Hunter downloads are saved to the selected Explorer partition root.
- If the card has not been mounted in the current session, press `F2` once to open the microSD list before downloading from File Hunter.
- Configure WiFi from the Explorer menu if the ESP module has not already been configured for your network.

### Opening File Hunter

Press `F3` from the Explorer menu. The menu frame is drawn immediately, then the lower-left status area shows "Retrieving File Hunter" in 80-column mode or "Retrieving..." in 40-column mode while the first page is fetched.

The initial File Hunter query starts with `1`, matching the current Explorer behavior for the first catalog request. After the first page is loaded, the browser shows the File Hunter result list with the same Explorer frame, footer, page counter, and 40/80-column support used by the normal menu.

### File Hunter list screen

Each result row shows:

- ROM name on the left.
- Size aligned to the right side of the row.
- Source label `FH`.
- Type label `ROM` aligned at the far right.

In 40-column mode, long selected names slide horizontally while the cursor remains on the row. In 80-column mode, longer names fit directly in the wider row.

The network state appears in the lower-left status area as "Network: Online" / "Network: Offline" in 80-column mode or "Net: Online" / "Net: Offline" in 40-column mode. The standard command hints stay on the right side of the last line.

### File Hunter controls

- **Up/Down**: Move through the result list.
- **Left/Right**: Change result pages.
- **Enter**: Open the selected ROM detail screen.
- **Space**: Quick-run the selected ROM with saved `.PVC` options or default settings. If the ROM is on microSD and its mapper has not been detected yet, Explorer detects it before launching.
- **/**: Search File Hunter. Type a query and press Enter to load matching results. Press Esc at the search prompt to cancel.
- **F1**: Leave File Hunter and return to the flash ROM list.
- **F2**: Leave File Hunter and return to the microSD list.
- **F3**: File Hunter is already selected; pressing it again has no effect.
- **F4**: Open WiFi configuration.
- **C**: Toggle 40/80-column mode when supported.
- **Esc**: Exit File Hunter and return to the normal Explorer menu.

### Searching File Hunter

Press `/` while inside File Hunter, type part of a title, and press Enter. Explorer sends that text as the File Hunter query and reloads the result list from page 1. Search text is limited to 24 characters.

If the ESP module is not connected to WiFi, the browser reports an offline state and the request fails instead of hanging indefinitely. When WiFi is still associating, the Pico waits briefly and shows a waiting status before reporting failure.

### ROM detail and download workflow

Selecting a File Hunter result opens a detail screen showing:

- ROM name.
- Size.
- Source: `FH`.
- Action: Download.

Press Enter or Space on the detail screen to download the selected ROM. Explorer first downloads the ROM from File Hunter into PSRAM. The status line shows a percentage counter from 0% to 100% while the download is active. After the download completes, the Pico saves the ROM from PSRAM to the root of the microSD card using the same filename shown by File Hunter.

When the save succeeds, the detail screen shows "Saved to microSD. Press key." Press any key to return to the File Hunter list. The Explorer root microSD list is refreshed after a successful save, so returning to the microSD root with `F2` lets you search for and launch the newly downloaded ROM as a normal SD ROM.

### File Hunter limitations and notes

- File Hunter requires a working ESP-01 / ESP8266 module and WiFi connection.
- A microSD card must be present because downloads are saved directly to the card root.
- Downloaded ROMs use File Hunter's filename. If a file with the same name already exists in the microSD root, it is replaced.
- Download and save speed depends on WiFi quality, the ESP module firmware, File Hunter response time, and microSD card performance.
- File Hunter entries are online catalog results, not flash entries. After saving, they become SD ROM entries.

## Known limitations

- Flash ROMs packaged by the tool must be in the root of the source folder (no subfolders in the flashing process, though SD folders are fully supported in the menu).
- The `-n` Nextor option is experimental and may not work on all MSX2 models.
- ROMs with unknown or unsupported mappers are skipped unless you force a mapper tag.
- Very deep folder nesting (more than 10+ levels) is supported but may have perception of slowness due to repeated folder scans.
- File Hunter browsing is unavailable without an ESP-01 / ESP8266 module, compatible ESP firmware, and a configured WiFi network.
- File Hunter downloads are stored in the root of the microSD card; Explorer does not create a separate File Hunter folder.

## MP3 player screen

Selecting an MP3 entry from the microSD card opens a dedicated player screen. MP3 files are not embedded in flash by the Explorer tool; copy them to the microSD card root or to folders on the card, then open the microSD list with `F2`.

The player screen shows the MP3 file name, size, playback status, and elapsed play time. The elapsed counter is refreshed while the screen is open. Total duration is not shown because Explorer does not scan the whole MP3 stream before playback.

The screen displays two selectable action rows:

1. **Action: Play / Stop**: starts playback when stopped, or stops the current file when playing or paused.
2. **Action: Pause / Resume**: pauses the current playback, or resumes it after pausing.

### Controls

- **Up/Down**: Move between the action rows.
- **Enter/Space**: Execute the selected action.
- **Esc**: Stop playback and return to the Explorer list.
- **C**: Toggle 40/80-column layout on supported systems.

### Audio behavior

MP3 decoding runs on the Pico side and streams stereo PCM to the cartridge I2S DAC. The MSX menu remains responsive while playback is active. The DAC mute line is released only while MP3 or ROM audio is active, and is muted again when playback stops or when Explorer returns to idle browsing.

## ROM screen

Selecting a ROM entry opens a ROM details screen before running:

- **Mapper**: Shows the detected mapper (for SD ROMs) and allows manual override using Left/Right.
- **Audio**: Choose an audio profile with Left/Right (None, SCC, SCC+, external SCC/SCC+, Dual PSG, MSX-MUSIC, SFG01/SFG05). The menu only cycles through profiles supported by the selected ROM mapper.
- **PSG**: Choose whether to mirror the MSX primary PSG writes through the cartridge DAC. The default is Yes unless saved `.PVC` options override it.
- **Wifi**: For Sunrise Nextor entries only, choose whether to expose the ESP8266P WiFi BIOS before running. The default is No.
- **SD Part**: For Sunrise Nextor SD entries only, choose the FAT16 partition up to 4 GB that Nextor will boot from. The selected partition is saved with the ROM options.
- **Action: Run**: Press Enter to launch the ROM.
- **Esc**: Return to the menu without running.

If a ROM mapper is unknown, the screen will briefly show "Detecting..." while the Pico attempts detection.

### Audio profile options

- **None**: No extra cartridge audio profile. The ROM still uses the MSX's built-in PSG normally.
- **SCC**: Enables Konami SCC (standard) sound emulation. Use this for games that use the standard SCC chip with shared channel 4/5 waveforms (e.g., *Space Manbow*, *Salamander*, *Nemesis 2*, *Gradius 2*).
- **SCC+**: Enables Konami SCC+ (enhanced/SCC-I) sound emulation. Use this for games or homebrew that require SCC+ features with independent channel 4/5 waveforms.
- **SCC - External**: Exposes a virtual SCC cartridge in a secondary subslot while keeping the selected game mapper in the primary game subslot. Use this for ROMs that look for an SCC cartridge in another slot.
- **SCC+ - External**: Same as **SCC - External**, but with the enhanced SCC+ register model.
- **YM2151 (SFG05)**: Exposes a Yamaha SFG-05-like YM2151 cartridge surface and the SFG-05 BIOS image in a secondary subslot while keeping the selected game mapper in the primary game subslot. Use this for ROMs that scan another slot for SFG/YM2151 hardware.
- **YM2151 (SFG01)**: Exposes the SFG-01 BIOS image with the same YM2151 register surface for software that distinguishes SFG01/SFG05 setups.
- **Dual PSG**: Enables a secondary AY-3-8910 compatible PSG on I/O ports `0x10` (register select) and `0x11` (data write), matching the common Carnivore2 / MegaFlashROM / FlashJacks style second-PSG convention. Use this for ROMs or patches that explicitly support dual PSG music.
- **MSX-MUSIC**: Enables YM2413/MSX-MUSIC audio using an FM-PAC-compatible BIOS from the Explorer UF2 flash payload. Use this for regular ROMs that can use MSX-MUSIC ports `0x7C` and `0x7D`; Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM entries also expose the FM-PAC BIOS in a free expanded subslot.

Explorer treats audio profiles as mutually exclusive: a ROM can run with no extra audio, SCC, SCC+, external SCC/SCC+, Dual PSG, MSX-MUSIC, or YM2151/SFG, but not multiple cartridge audio engines at the same time.

The **PSG** field is independent from the Audio profile. When set to **Yes**, Explorer mirrors writes to the primary MSX PSG ports `0xA0` and `0xA1`, generates matching AY/YM audio on the Pico, and sends that audio through the cartridge I2S DAC. The real MSX PSG is not disabled; the option provides a DAC-side copy of the main PSG. It can be combined with **None**, **SCC**, **SCC+**, external SCC/SCC+, **Dual PSG**, **MSX-MUSIC**, or **YM2151 (SFG01/SFG05)**, so PSG music can be heard through the cartridge DAC together with the selected cartridge audio profile. When **Dual PSG** and **PSG: Yes** are enabled together, Explorer routes Dual PSG to the left channel and the mirrored primary PSG to the right channel for a stereo split. The option defaults to **Yes** unless saved `.PVC` options override it.

The SCC and SCC+ audio profiles work with ROMs using the Konami SCC mapper (`KonSCC`) or the Manbow2 mapper (`MANBW2`). When a ROM is detected as `KonSCC` or `MANBW2`, the ROM screen pre-selects **SCC** in the Audio field; you can change it to None, SCC+, or one of the external SCC profiles before pressing Run. Dual PSG and MSX-MUSIC are not offered for these mappers because the cartridge audio slot is reserved for SCC/SCC+.

The external SCC and SCC+ profiles are available for non-SYSTEM ROM entries and Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM entries. Non-SYSTEM ROMs launch in an expanded cartridge layout with the selected game mapper in subslot 0 and the virtual SCC/SCC+ cartridge surface in subslot 1. Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM launches keep Nextor storage in its normal subslot, keep mapper RAM available only for the explicit `+ 1MB Mapper` entries, and place the virtual SCC/SCC+ cartridge in subslot 2 without WiFi or subslot 3 when WiFi is enabled. This is intended for games, loaders, or Nextor BASIC sessions that explicitly scan for an SCC cartridge in another slot.

The YM2151 SFG01/SFG05 profiles are available for supported non-SYSTEM ROM entries and Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM entries. Non-SYSTEM ROMs use the same expanded layout as the external SCC profiles: subslot 0 remains the selected game mapper, while subslot 1 exposes an SFG-like memory-mapped YM2151 surface and the selected Yamaha SFG BIOS image. Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM launches use a mapper-backed expanded layout so Nextor still has RAM available; the SFG surface is placed in subslot 2 without WiFi or subslot 3 when WiFi is enabled. The implemented SFG memory window responds at slot-local `0x3FF0` for the YM2151 address register and `0x3FF1` for YM2151 data/status. MIDI/keyboard-facing SFG addresses return idle values in this first implementation. The Explorer UF2 stores `SFG_64K.ROM` as a hidden flash payload; the SFG05 profile exposes the first 32K BIOS image and the SFG01 profile exposes the second 32K BIOS image.

The Dual PSG and MSX-MUSIC profiles are available for regular non-SYSTEM ROMs that are not Konami SCC or Manbow2, and Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM entries can use the SYSTEM audio service for the supported SYSTEM profiles. When MSX-MUSIC is selected for Sunrise Nextor, Explorer keeps the Nextor storage layout active and places the FM-PAC BIOS/control surface in subslot 2 without WiFi or subslot 3 with WiFi. These cartridge audio profiles are not offered for NEO system entries, folders, or SCC-capable ROMs.

Primary PSG mirroring is intended for normal ROM launches from flash or microSD, including ROMs downloaded from File Hunter after they have been saved to the card. SYSTEM/storage entries that reserve core 1 for storage backends do not use the PSG DAC mirror path.

## SCC/SCC+ sound emulation

The PicoVerse 2350 Explorer firmware can emulate the Konami SCC and SCC+ (SCC-I) sound chips in hardware, generating audio through an I2S DAC connected to the RP2350. This gives MSX games that use SCC or SCC+ sound their full soundtrack without requiring an original SCC cartridge. Native SCC/SCC+ profiles attach the emulated SCC to Konami SCC or Manbow2 mapper launches; external SCC/SCC+ profiles expose the emulated chip as a separate virtual cartridge subslot for non-SYSTEM ROMs and Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM entries that search another slot for SCC hardware.

## Dual PSG sound emulation

The PicoVerse 2350 Explorer firmware can also emulate a second AY-3-8910 compatible PSG for ROMs that write to the standard secondary PSG ports. The Pico captures writes to `0x10` and `0x11`, feeds them to the emulated PSG, and streams the generated audio through the same I2S DAC path used by the other cartridge audio engines.

The MSX's internal PSG remains active as usual. The Dual PSG profile adds the external/secondary PSG only; software must be written or patched to use ports `0x10` and `0x11` for the extra three channels.

For firmware architecture, port handling, audio routing, and LoadROM/Explorer differences, see the [PicoVerse 2350 Dual PSG implementation guide](./msx-picoverse-2350-dualpsg.md).

## Primary PSG mirroring

Explorer can also mirror the normal MSX PSG output through the cartridge DAC. This is controlled by the separate **PSG** field on the ROM screen, not by the Audio profile field.

When **PSG: Yes** is selected, the Pico captures writes to the primary PSG ports `0xA0` and `0xA1`, feeds them to an AY/YM-compatible `emu2149` instance, and mixes the generated samples into the active I2S audio stream. If no other cartridge audio profile is selected, Explorer starts a PSG-only I2S audio loop. If SCC, SCC+, external SCC/SCC+, Dual PSG, MSX-MUSIC, or YM2151/SFG is selected, the primary PSG mirror is mixed into that profile's DAC stream. In the specific **Dual PSG + PSG** combination, Explorer outputs the Dual PSG stream on left and the primary PSG mirror on right.

This does not replace or mute the physical PSG inside the MSX. It is useful when you want ROM PSG music and effects on the same cartridge DAC output as SCC, Dual PSG, or MSX-MUSIC.

## MSX-MUSIC emulation

The PicoVerse 2350 Explorer firmware can emulate the YM2413/MSX-MUSIC audio chip and expose an FM-PAC-compatible BIOS in an expanded cartridge slot when the **MSX-MUSIC** audio profile is selected. The BIOS is stored as a hidden payload in the Explorer UF2 after the WiFi configuration and ESP8266P BIOS payloads; it is read from flash at launch time and is not compiled into the Pico firmware binary.

MSX-MUSIC uses I/O ports `0x7C` for register select and `0x7D` for data writes, with synthesized audio routed to the same I2S DAC path used by the other Explorer audio profiles. The profile is mutually exclusive with SCC, SCC+, and Dual PSG, and is only offered for regular non-SYSTEM ROMs that are not Konami SCC or Manbow2.

## YM2151 / Yamaha SFG emulation

Explorer can expose a virtual Yamaha SFG01/SFG05-style YM2151 device for supported non-SYSTEM ROMs and Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM entries. For game ROMs, the selected game mapper stays in subslot 0 and the SFG-like surface appears in subslot 1. For Sunrise Nextor SYSTEM entries, Explorer keeps the Nextor ROM and mapper RAM layout active and places the SFG-like surface in the free expanded subslot.

The SFG register window is memory-mapped, following the SFG layout used by emulator and hardware references: slot-local `0x3FF0` selects the YM2151 register, and slot-local `0x3FF1` writes YM2151 data or reads YM2151 status. Outside the top register aperture, the virtual SFG subslot reads from the selected 32K BIOS image stored in the Explorer flash payload.
